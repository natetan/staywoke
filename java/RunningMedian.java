/**
 * Daily Coding Problem: Problem #33 [Easy]
 * 
 * This problem was asked by Microsoft.
 * 
 * Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream
 * of numbers print out the median of the list so far on each new element.
 * 
 * Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two
 * middle numbers.
 * 
 * For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should
 * print out: (new line with no commas)
 * 
 * 2, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 2, 2, 2
